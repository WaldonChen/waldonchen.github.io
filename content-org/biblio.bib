  abstract        = {We introduce a learning-based framework to optimize tensor
                  programs for deep learning workloads. Efficient
                  implementations of tensor operators, such as matrix
                  multiplication and high dimensional convolution, are key
                  enablers of effective deep learning systems. However, current
                  systems rely on manually optimized libraries, e.g., cuDNN,
                  that support only a narrow range of server class GPUs. Such
                  reliance limits the applicability of high-level graph
                  optimizations and incurs significant engineering costs when
                  deploying to new hardware targets. We use learning to remove
                  this engineering burden. We learn domain-specific statistical
                  cost models to guide the search of tensor operator
                  implementations over billions of possible program variants. We
                  further accelerate the search using effective model transfer
                  across workloads. Experimental results show that our framework
                  delivers performance that is competitive with state-of-the-art
                  hand-tuned libraries for low-power CPUs, mobile GPUs, and
                  server-class GPUs.},
